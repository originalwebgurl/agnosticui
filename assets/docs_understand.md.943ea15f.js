These standards compliant components are then copied to our framework implementations in: React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.</p><h2 id="approach" tabindex="-1">Approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#approach" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h3 id="decoupled-css" tabindex="-1">Decoupled CSS <a class="header-anchor" href="#decoupled-css" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>AgnosticUI is not tied to a particular JavaScript framework, because our build process complies and even enforces the \u201C1 stylesheet\u2026many frameworks\u201D approach which works as follows:</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>Our first step to building a component (like a Button) starts in the <code>agnostic-css</code> package. Generally, this results in a <code>component.html</code> file, and a <code>component.css</code> file. For example, <code>button.html</code> and <code>button.css</code>.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>When we&#39;re ready to create a corresponding component (e.g. a React button), we utilize a simple <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NodeJS script</a> that literally copies the <code>component.css</code> (e.g. <code>button.css</code>) into the framework&#39;s component directory and import it directly.</p><div class="mbe16"></div><p><em>For Svelte and Vue&#39;s <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/single-file-component.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SFC</a> we instead replace the contents within the <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code> tags.</em></p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>The above approach forces our framework-specific implementations to use the same single stylesheet. Ultimately, this means you can make <a href="https://agnosticui.com/docs/theming.html#example-of-theming-with-css-custom-properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theme customizations</a> once, then use these CSS custom property overrides across your React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte based applications\u2026and they will have a consistent look and feel!</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p><em>If you&#39;re curious, there&#39;s an article (coming very soon!) <s>on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">css-tricks</a> \u2014 <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Little Button That Could</a></s> \u2014 that describes exactly how this all gets set up in painstaking details.</em></p><h3 id="frameworks" tabindex="-1">Frameworks <a class="header-anchor" href="#frameworks" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>AgnosticUI has 5 packages.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>The <code>agnostic-css</code> package is where all component HTML and CSS starts. All styles derive from this package as described earlier.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>The framework-specific implementations available are: <code>agnostic-react</code>, <code>agnostic-vue</code>, <code>agnostic-angular</code>, and <code>agnostic-svelte</code>.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><h3 id="primitives" tabindex="-1">Primitives <a class="header-anchor" href="#primitives" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Think of the components AgnosticUI provides as <em>primitive</em> or <em>presentational components</em> that you can build atop. We purposely avoid overly complex components like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/grid/dataGrids.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Grid</a> in efforts to keep AgnosticUI&#39;s core as minimal and maintainable as possible.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p><em>We may consider a community-driven <code>addons</code> repository in the future for more complex components that don&#39;t belong in core if there&#39;s support from the community.</em></p><h3 id="clean-css" tabindex="-1">Clean CSS <a class="header-anchor" href="#clean-css" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Broadly-speaking, AgnosticUI&#39;s CSS follows <a href="https://snook.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Snook&#39;s</a> <a href="http://smacss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SMACSS</a> and <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Sullivan&#39;s</a> <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/tree/master/oocss#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OOCSS</a>. <a href="https://markdotto.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Otto</a> describes a similar approach in his article on using <a href="https://markdotto.com/2012/02/16/scope-css-classes-with-prefixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chained classes</a>.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p><em>We don&#39;t generally follow the state rules in SMACSS like <code>is-STATE</code> e.g. we&#39;ll generally favor using native <code>[disabled]</code> over creating an extra class <code>.is-disabled</code> since it&#39;s likely that we&#39;ve needed to interact with the native <code>[disabled]</code> from JavaScript anyway. There&#39;s an exception: if we&#39;ve disabled an anchor tag by adding the <code>[disabled]</code> attribute, but we want to further add a class on its parent wrapper, that class on the parent may in fact use <code>is-disabled</code>. To add to the confusion, our JavaScript framework props do in fact use <code>isState</code> props to allow consumers to specify the state of a component.</em> \u{1F60E}</p><h3 id="no-preprocessing" tabindex="-1">No Preprocessing <a class="header-anchor" href="#no-preprocessing" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>While preprocessors certainly supply an enjoyable developer experience, AgnosticUI favors the use of standards-based raw CSS. This means structures like loops, maps, and lists, are not available. Essentially, these sorts of structures need to be <em>unrolled</em>, and thus the code is a bit more verbose. But, the benefit of coding directly on the platform and moving towards upcoming web standards seems worth it. Of course, we do use <code>autoprefixer</code> to help out with any vendor prefix shenanigans.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><h3 id="components-tokens-utilities" tabindex="-1">Components + Tokens + Utilities <a class="header-anchor" href="#components-tokens-utilities" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>AgnosticUI mostly consists of UI components and the CSS custom properties mentioned in the Theming section. However, for convenience we&#39;ve included some minimal <a href="https://css-tricks.com/need-css-utility-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Utilities</a> in <a href="https://github.com/AgnosticUI/agnosticui/tree/master/agnostic-css/public/css-src" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">common</a>. These are mostly for rapid layout development using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flexbox</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">margin/padding via logical properties</a>. At time of writing, AgnosticUI adds these with some trepidation as we don&#39;t want to increase the build size. If you&#39;re looking for a full-blown utility-first library you should probably look at TailWind or similar.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>The <a href="./utilities.html">utilities page</a> shows the available CSS utilities as does the <a href="https://github.com/AgnosticUI/agnosticui/blob/master/agnostic-css/public/css-dist/common.concat.css#L276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="benefits" tabindex="-1">Benefits <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>As AgnosticUI works across many frameworks\u2014one stylesheet\u2026many frameworks\u2014your design system team will be able to generate a \u201Csingle source of truth\u201D. This theme will manifest as a single <a href="https://agnosticui.com/docs/theming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS custom properties theme</a> that can be imported across your various projects.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>For example, let&#39;s imagine your company&#39;s flagship product is coded in React, an administraction site is coded in Vue 3, and a back-office application is coded in Angular. All of these would share the same <a href="https://agnosticui.com/docs/theming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS custom properties theme</a>, and would therefore have a consistent look and feel.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p>Then, your front-end developer \u201Crock star\u201D decides she wants to use Svelte on that <em>hackathon project</em>. Well, she can simply drop in the <a href="https://agnosticui.com/docs/theming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom properties theme</a> and get right to hacking up her Svelte idea.</p><div class="mbe24"></div><p><em>We don&#39;t recommend the use of 2+ frameworks in an application with a single HTTP payload due to the increased bundle size that will be sent down to your users. However, completely separate applications are fair game for using different front-end frameworks; especially for polyglot teams that long to use new technologies, or letting an outsourced team use the technology they&#39;re most proficient in.</em></p><h2 id="roadmap" tabindex="-1">Roadmap <a class="header-anchor" href="#roadmap" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>As AgnosticUI is still very much in its infancy, we advise you to hold off using it for mission critical production applications.
